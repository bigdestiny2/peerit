// verify.js — record authenticity. The ONLY thing that makes a record
// trustworthy is a valid Ed25519 signature from the key it claims as author.

// every fabricated record fails this check and is dropped by the merge.

//                   'bad'          forged / tampered / wrong signer / unsigned (secure mode)
//                   'unverifiable' no crypto backend at all (cooperative dev only)
