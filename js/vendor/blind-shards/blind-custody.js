/**
 * Blind-custody dispersal — the app-facing one-call orchestration over a relay
 * set. It ties together the pieces proven separately:
 *
 *   planDispersal (blind-shards)  — split a secret into n opaque shards
 *   createHttpShardPut/Fetch (shard-transport) — move them over /api/v1/shard
 *   the custody intent            — the signed binding a relay authorizes against
 *
 * `disperse()` plans the shards, assigns share i to relay i (so no operator holds
 * >= threshold), lets the app PUBLISH the signed custody intent (relays authorize
 * PUTs against it) and SIGN each custody pin, then PUTs every shard to its relay.
 * `recover()` gathers >= threshold shards from the relay set and reconstructs the
 * secret at the reader's edge.
 *
 * SIGNING + PUBLISHING ARE INJECTED, not done here: the publisher key and each
 * relay's write credential belong to the app, and the custody-pin signature must
 * stay byte-identical to the relay's verifier. This module owns the ORCHESTRATION
 * (planning, relay assignment, routing, reconstruction) — never the app's keys.
 *
 * The returned `shareAssignments` + `shareManifest` + `commitmentRoot` are exactly
 * the fields a v2 custody intent binds, so the app can build/sign the intent with
 * custody.js `createCustodyIntent` and hand it to `publishIntent`.
